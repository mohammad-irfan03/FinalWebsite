                <h2>What is Your Target Technology?</h2>
                <p>Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are at the forefront of modern transportation innovation. These vehicles rely on cutting-edge technologies, including sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras, to gather real-time data about their surroundings. Advanced machine learning algorithms process this data to make driving decisions that are safe and efficient, reducing or eliminating the need for human intervention.</p>
                <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) classifies self-driving capabilities into six levels, ranging from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation with no human input required). At higher levels, the vehicles can handle complex environments like urban traffic or adverse weather conditions autonomously.</p>

                <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles are not just a technological marvel but a solution to critical challenges in transportation. According to the World Health Organization, over 1.3 million people die in traffic accidents annually, with human error accounting for over 90% of these incidents. Self-driving cars aim to minimize these tragedies by reducing human error.</p>
                <p>Beyond safety, these vehicles improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and optimize fuel usage, contributing to environmental sustainability. For individuals with disabilities or the elderly, self-driving cars provide newfound independence and mobility.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the economic implications include savings on fuel and maintenance due to optimized driving patterns, as well as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when coupled with electric vehicles.</p>

                <h2>Applications of Self-Driving Cars</h2>
                <p>The versatility of self-driving cars extends across multiple domains. Personal transportation is perhaps the most visible application, offering convenience for commuters and travelers. Public transit systems are testing self-driving buses and shuttles to provide reliable and efficient transportation services.</p>
                <p>The logistics industry is also being transformed by autonomous trucks designed for long-haul freight, reducing delivery times and operational costs. Companies like Amazon are exploring self-driving delivery vehicles to optimize their supply chains and ensure faster deliveries. Emergency services may soon deploy autonomous vehicles to reach patients quickly and navigate hazardous environments safely.</p>
