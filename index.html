                <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles aim to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and provide mobility for those unable to drive. Statistics suggest a potential 90% reduction in accidents caused by human error, saving thousands of lives annually.</p>
                <p>Additionally, self-driving cars could lead to smarter urban planning and lower greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary trips.</p>

                <h2>Self-Driving Cars Application Domain</h2>
                <p>The integration of self-driving cars into society raises questions about their impact on the job market, urban planning, and environmental sustainability. Delivery services, ride-sharing platforms, and even emergency response vehicles are potential beneficiaries.</p>
                <p>However, the technology faces challenges in ethical decision-making, regulatory approval, and public trust. These factors require thorough exploration for successful adoption.</p>

                <h2>Real-Life Example: Waymo and Tesla</h2>
                <p>Waymo has been at the forefront of self-driving technology, deploying autonomous vehicles in cities like Phoenix, Arizona. Their Waymo One service offers ride-sharing using fully autonomous cars, demonstrating the potential for public transportation without drivers.</p>
                <p>Tesla, another leader in the field, incorporates "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) features in its electric vehicles, allowing for advanced driver assistance on highways and city streets. Although not fully autonomous yet, Teslaâ€™s approach highlights how incremental advancements can shape consumer adoption of self-driving technology.</p>
