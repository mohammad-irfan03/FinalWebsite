                <h2>Ethical Dilemmas and Decision-Making</h2>
                <p>Self-driving cars face "no-win" situations where they must decide whose safety to prioritize—passengers, pedestrians, or other drivers. Determining who sets these rules is a challenge, as cultural and moral biases differ globally.</p>
                <p>For example, a study on ethical preferences showed that individuals from Western cultures prioritize individual lives, while Eastern cultures favor collective safety. These perspectives influence programming decisions.</p>

                <h2>Liability and Regulation</h2>
                <p>With autonomous vehicles, it's unclear who is responsible in accidents—the owner, manufacturer, or software developer. Clear regulations are needed to address accountability and licensing requirements.</p>
                <p>Countries like Germany have started implementing preliminary legal frameworks, but international standards are still lacking.</p>

                <h2>Cybersecurity and Safety Risks</h2>
                <p>Self-driving cars are vulnerable to hacking due to their reliance on connectivity for updates and GPS. Without strong cybersecurity measures, they could pose serious safety risks, such as remote takeovers or data breaches.</p>
                <p>Robust encryption, regular software updates, and decentralized networks are vital to mitigate these risks.</p>
