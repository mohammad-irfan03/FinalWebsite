                <h2>Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
                <p>Self-driving cars face numerous ethical dilemmas, particularly in "no-win" scenarios where harm is unavoidable. For instance, if a car must choose between colliding with pedestrians or risking passenger safety, how should it decide? These decisions require complex algorithms that incorporate ethical principles, but the challenge lies in the global diversity of moral values.</p>
                <p>Cultural influences also play a role. Studies indicate Western cultures may prioritize individual lives, while Eastern cultures often focus on collective welfare. Incorporating these perspectives into programming raises significant ethical and technical challenges.</p>

                <h2>Liability and Accountability</h2>
                <p>The question of liability is one of the most contentious aspects of autonomous vehicles. When accidents occur, it is unclear who should be held accountableâ€”the owner, the manufacturer, or the software developers. Specific scenarios, such as allowing unlicensed passengers like children to ride alone, add further complexity.</p>
                <p>Countries like Germany have introduced initial legal frameworks, but broader international standards are needed to ensure consistency in accountability and regulation.</p>

                <h2>Ethical Lenses and Interpretations</h2>
                <p><b>Utilitarian Lens:</b> This perspective focuses on maximizing societal benefits. Self-driving cars are seen as tools to reduce accidents, improve traffic efficiency, and minimize commute times. However, this viewpoint may downplay individual harms or ethical dilemmas in rare but severe incidents.</p>
                <p><b>Deontological Lens:</b> This lens emphasizes adherence to moral obligations and principles, such as fairness, accountability, and respect for human dignity. For example, ensuring that all stakeholders (engineers, manufacturers, governments) are held accountable for accidents reflects this ethical perspective.</p>
                <p>Depending on the ethical framework, the technology's social impact may be justified by its broader benefits (utilitarianism) or scrutinized for its adherence to moral standards (deontology).</p>

                <h2>Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
                <p>As self-driving cars are increasingly connected to the internet for software updates and navigation, they become prime targets for hackers. The potential for remote takeovers poses risks not only to individual safety but also to public infrastructure. For instance, coordinated cyberattacks could disrupt entire transportation systems.</p>
                <p>To mitigate these risks, companies must implement robust encryption methods, regular security audits, and decentralized network protocols.</p>
